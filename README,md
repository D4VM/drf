This is a basic e-commerce app with a REST API. It allows users to create an account, login, and view/modify their orders. The API is built with Django Rest Framework and swagger docs are generated using drf-spectacular.
The app is built with Django 5.0.4 and Python 3.9.

The codebase is organized into apps for user and order management and the product API.

The frontend is not included in this repo but feel free to make one if you want.
